# Lambda Expressoins

Lambda expressions basically express instances of functional interfaces (An interface with single abstract method is called functional interface. An example is java.lang.Runnable). Lambda expressions implement the only abstract function and therefore implement functional interfaces

#### It provides a clear and concise way to represent one method interface using an expression. It is very useful in collection library. It helps to iterate, filter and extract data from collection.

Lambda expressions are added in Java 8 and provide below functionalities:

- Enable to treat functionality as a method argument, or code as data.
- A function that can be created without belonging to any class.
- A lambda expression can be passed around as if it was an object and executed on demand.
